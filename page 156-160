1. How many years does it take for the investment to triple? Modify the program
and run it.

It takes 23 years for the investment to triple
RATE = 5.0
INITIAL_BALANCE = 10000.0
TARGET = 3 * INITIAL_BALANCE

balance = INITIAL_BALANCE
year = 0

while balance < TARGET :
    year = year + 1
    interest = balance * RATE / 100
    balance = balance + interest

print("The investment tripled after", year, "years.")

2. If the interest rate is 10 percent per year, how many years does it take for the
investment to double? Modify the program and run it.

It takes only 8 years for the investment to double.
RATE = 10.0
INITIAL_BALANCE = 10000.0
TARGET = 2 * INITIAL_BALANCE

balance = INITIAL_BALANCE
year = 0

while balance < TARGET :
    year = year + 1
    interest = balance * RATE / 100
    balance = balance + interest

print("The investment double after", year, "years.")

3. Modify the program so that the balance after each year is printed. How did you
do that?

RATE = 10.0
INITIAL_BALANCE = 10000.0
TARGET = 2 * INITIAL_BALANCE

balance = INITIAL_BALANCE
year = 0

while balance < TARGET :
    year = year + 1
    print(balance)
    interest = balance * RATE / 100
    balance = balance + interest

print("The investment double after", year, "years.")

I put print(balance) inside the loop.

4. Suppose we change the program so that the condition of the while loop is while balance <= TARGET :
What is the effect on the program? Why?

There was no effect the result remained the same.

5.What does the following loop print?

n = 1
while n < 100 :
n = 2 * n
print(n)

This prints out:
2
4
8
16
32
64
128
